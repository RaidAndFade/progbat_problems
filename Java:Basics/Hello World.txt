Welcome to the first Basics of Programming. 
This problem is specifically for Java,
Java programs require a `public static void main` function, this is required for the computer to know what to do first.

In Java we have many ways to output to the screen, but the most used and most obvious way is to use

System.out.print or System.out.println

Try to print "Hello World!"

Hello World!

Welcome to the second Basics of Programming. 

This website is made for challenges with specific functions, because of this, from now on you will only see single functions. 

In Java, Functions take in arguments in the brackets, and return things using the Return Keyword.

The function below shows how to return "Hello World!",
Change it so that it returns "Nice weather outside!"

Credit for this problem goes to Nick Parlante from CodingBat.com
